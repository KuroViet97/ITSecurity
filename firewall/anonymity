Anonymity
- cannot be linked back 
- apply jobs
How to achieve anonymity:
- get anonymous card (not registered your name) 
--> location of the phone can be tracked/ tracked the calling phone number => not effective
- How to trace example:
1. Call parents regularly (telephony track)
2. wire phones - legal intercept 
anonymous phones => not switch on more than 1 phone at the same time

Anonymous connection for PCs
Threats & How to counter in each layer
1. Physical layer: find cable/cellphone belongs to (electrical engineer)

2. Datalink layer: MAC address - list of people & list of MAC => can map together => break anonymity. Example: Wifi checking in hotel -> MAC address: map device to a specific person, wifi in coffe shops (Starbucks----->database of mac: can be used to profiled a user)

--MAC address: can check wire/wireless
--Embedded MAC to IP adress: server uniquely identifies the machine 

3. Network layer: IP address used for routing. User can be easility identified 

4. Transport layer: certificate

5. Application layer: log in to identify = break anonymity | tracked with cookies (third-party cookies)

How to achieve Anonymity
- SSH Port Forwarding / VPN 
- SSH to other server: just shifting problem to another party => info can still be disclosed and identity can be tracked (also applied to VPN)

==> Solution: TOR (not 100%)
- works with arbitrary TCP protocols (not only browsing) => everyone appears to be the same user
How TOR works:
- Initialize circuit consisting of 3 machines 
+ TCP triple-encrupted into 3 layers
+ send data from client -> first tor node cascade -> break encryption -> see the data & know to send to node 2
+ node 2 breaks next layer encryption & know to node 3
+ node 3 decrypts final layer -> send to destination
==> Why guarantee anonymity? Client talks to node 1, node 1 talks to client, node 2 only knows node 1,... => server knows only the last node ===> at least 1 node is secure or does not have the log file =====> cannot be traced back (Unless all nodes cooperate, anonymity is ensured)

==> Risk: unencrypted info from last node -> server: sniff traffic -> modify & manupilate
